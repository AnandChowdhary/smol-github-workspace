# Smol GitHub Copilot Workspace

This is an example of a GitHub Actions workflow that uses the OpenAI Assistants API so give you an AI assistant that **creates pull requests from issues automatically**. Think of it as a baby version of GitHub Copilot Workspace which can read, write, update, and delete files in your repository.

To test it out, create a new issue. Describe the change you'd like to make, for example "Make the index.html button text red" and in a few moments, a pull request should be created with your changes ✨ automatically ✨. 

> [!CAUTION]
> This repository uses my personal OpenAI API key, please use with care.
